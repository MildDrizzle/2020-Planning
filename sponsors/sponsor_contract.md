 SPONSORSHIP CONTRACT 2020 
===========================

**Background**

BSides Aarhus is a community driven, vendor neutral information security
conference based on the worldwide Security BSides concept as described on
<http://securitybsides.com/>.

BSides Aarhus is a newly founded conference, as it will launch on XXXXX
2020 at XXXXXXXX in Aarhus.

The target audience is IT and information security consultants, information
security officers and other security professionals combined with an interesting
mix of students. This is a unique opportunity to build your brand towards a very
senior and targeted security audience and some of the future security
professionals. This first year, the estimated turnout is around 100 attendees
and around 8 presenters. This will likely be increased already in 2021 where we
will start to experiment with scaling the event towards a larger audience, more
presenters, etc.

With this sponsorship you have the chance to be part of something unique, right
from the very beginning. Going forward, as a founding sponsor, you will have an
advantage towards others who weren’t there from the beginning as sponsorships
moving forward, will be available to founding sponsors before anyone else.

The conference will be a single-track conference with slots ranging from 5-60
minutes. We aim for all presentations being conducted in English, as we aim to
include all Aarhus-based IT and information security enthusiasts and
professionals. However, if a given presenter is more comfortable doing his or
her talk in Danish, BSides Aarhus will accommodate those presenters. There
will be opportunities during breaks for the sponsors to interact with the
attendees, as well as opportunities during the networking event at the end of
the conference.

The conference organizers have procured a sponsor package available to any
company who wishes to support the event as set forth below.

GENERAL INFORMATION 
====================

Regardless of the amount sponsored by your organization, the following benefits
are included in the package:

-   Each sponsor will be advertised as such on the BSides Aarhus website
    <https://www.xxxxxxxx.dk> together with a link to the sponsors’ web site.

-   Each sponsor will be provided with two conference tickets.

-   Each sponsor will have the opportunity to have a café table setup just
    outside the auditorium where talks are held. (table will be provided by
    BSides Aarhus)

-   Each sponsor may apply to bring additional equipment to be placed alongside
    their café table with suitable equipment or entertainment accessories, such
    as pinball machines, games, challenges, demonstration devices etc. (Space is
    limited so contact BSides Aarhus organizers early for more information.)

-   Each sponsor will be listed with logo on all electronic presentations as
    well as printed A3 posters around the venue. Each sponsor will also be
    individually mentioned and thanked during the beginning and the end of the
    conference.

-   Each sponsor will have the opportunity to participate in the job match
    activity we have arranged for the day; job seekers will wear one color
    armband, employers another so this is clearly marked, and ad-hoc interviews
    can take place. We urge our sponsors to respect the colored armbands at all
    times.

**DISCLAIMER**: ​The BSides Aarhus organizers reserve the right to accept or
decline sponsors at their own discretion. Do note the following:

-   Sponsorship is not a fast lane past the Call for Presentations process;
    sponsorship will not automatically give you a presentation slot at the
    conference. Sponsors are encouraged to submit talks to the normal Call for
    Presentations process.

-   Lists of attendees will not be provided since privacy is a strong concern
    for most of our attendees.

-   The sponsorship does not guarantee a spot for the next year conference.
    However, as outlined in the introduction, we encourage and prefer long term
    sponsorships with priority being given to those sponsors that are part of
    the founding conference.

-   We encourage our sponsors to respect the core idea of the BSides community

    -   “Each BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and
        by information security community members. The goal is to expand the
        spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and
        time. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and
        participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It
        is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from
        participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are
        happening”
