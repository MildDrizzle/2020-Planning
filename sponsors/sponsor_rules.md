# Sponsor Rules
To uphold high quality sponsors, all sponsors must be carefully selected by following the below guidelines:

* Sponsors must have a relationship to the information security community.
* Sponsors must sign the [sponsorship contract](sponsor_contract.md).
* No sponsorship differentiation (bronze/silver/gold tiers etc.) on media or venue (website, posters or space size at the conference).
* Must abide by the [CoC](https://github.com/BSides-Aarhus/Association/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) (Code of Conduct)
