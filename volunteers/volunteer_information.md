## Interested in helping at BSides Aarhus?
BSides Aarhus is a security event that would not be possible without the work of our local community. Every year, the organizers work hard to build a fun and exciting agenda so that you can experience the latest in cool security happenings. However, as a community event, we rely on contributions from volunteers like you to help with various tasks on the day(s) of the event. Join us!

## What’s in it for me?
Volunteering is a great way to get involved with the local security scene and community, especially if you are a newcomer. It’s a good chance to meet other security-minded people while picking up various skills along the way. All volunteers that work for a minimum of 4 hours will get a free BSides Aarhus t-shirt + badge (and food), which means you can attend talks during the times that you are not volunteering. All we ask is that you dedicate a few hours of your time to help us out!

# Roles
The following descibes the roles that we need volunteers to fill.

## Registration / Information Desk
Working at the registration desk you will be responsible for checking attendees registration on a list, giving out badges, bags, and potentially answering general information questions.

The bulk of registration happens on the first day.
There are 4 shifts to registration, and we do not expect volunteers to work 4 straight shifts. 

The shifts are 8:30 to 9:45 for which we will need 5 volunteers, 11 to 12:30 for which we will need 2 people, 1 to 1:30 and 2 to 3:30 which will require only 1 person. For the second day there are two shifts 8:30 to 9:45, and then 11 to 12:30 both of which will only require 2 people.

Registration desk volunteers will be able to watch the keynote, as registration is shut down during this time.
